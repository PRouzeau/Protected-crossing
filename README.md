# Protected-crossing
Application to design protected crossroads 'dutch style'.

This means (see images):
- Physical protection of bike path with 'islands'
- Views on proper angles: motorised vehicles have already engaged their turn before crossing bike path and pedestrian way
- Car 'storage boxes' to stop before bike path without obstructing main flow
- Advanced bike light/position to allow bike croos before motorised vehicles. 

Can also design roundabout in the same Dutch style.
